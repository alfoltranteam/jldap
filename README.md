# Java LDAP #

The LDAP Class Libraries for Java ([JLDAP](http://www.openldap.org/jldap/)) enable you to write applications to access,
manage, update, and search for information stored in directories accessible using LDAPv3. JLDAP was developed by
[Novell](http://www.novell.com/). Latest sources are available in the OpenLDAP
[CVS Repository](http://www.openldap.org/software/repo.html).

* This is a fork of the original project with the goal of providing a project using Apache Maven. This project will be
  used, tested and evolved to integrate a new Web project that uses Java 8, Apache Wicket and Spring.
